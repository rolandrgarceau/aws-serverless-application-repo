First, if you have done some API work before Oct 2018, there is new single 
property setting in AWS SAM to define Amazon API Gateway Authorizers and control 
who can access your Amazon API Gateway APIs using an Amazon Cognito User Pool or 
an API Gateway Lambda Authorizer (used to be called custom authorizers). That is 
great. It's a property directly in the SAM template. 

There are links below to follow for more information from:
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/10/aws-sam-supports-amazon-api-gateway-authorizers/

Cognito Auth example:
